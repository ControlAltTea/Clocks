Using OOP, this web app allows you to compare multiple timezones, using OOP. Each clock is in 12-hour tim, staring with Japan.

## Tech Used : ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Javascript-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)

Using Unity to create the outline shader and mouse detection, we then created every 3D object using Blender to model and Substance Painter to create textures and materials.

## How It's Made

using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each clock is an object with 3 properties: region name, timezone, and UTC-offset.

## Optimizations

Originally his was an execires in CSS animations. It then was recreated in iterations using if/else statements, constructor functions and eventually a single class.

## Lessons Learned

Mostly how to use classes versus constuctor objects.
